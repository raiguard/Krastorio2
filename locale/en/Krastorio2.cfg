kr-finite-oil=Makes oil and mineral water finite with a constant production rate.
kr-impossible-more-than-difficult=[color=red]THIS MODE IS UNSUPPORTED, DO NOT REPORT BUGS REGARDING IT, THEY WILL NOT BE FIXED.[/color]\nDoubles the cost of ingredients for all recipes and technologies in expensive mode. This is different from the normal expensive mode, because instead of increasing the difficulty of [color=orange]focused[/color] recipes and/or technologies, it doubles all recipes, [color=orange]even recipes from other mods[/color]. Should not affect the normal mode, but you have no reason to activate this option if you don't play in expensive mode. (Disabled by default)
